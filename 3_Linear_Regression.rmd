### 3. Linear Regression

In R models are fitted using model-fitting function, that is 'lm()'. Usage is as follows 
'fm <- lm(formula,data,..)'. Generic functions such as `summary()`,`residuals()`,or `predict()` are available for all standard models.

#### 3.1. Simple Linear Regression

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load data
data("Journals")
Journals <- Journals[,c("subs","price")]
Journals$citeprice <- Journals$price/Journals$citations
```

```{r}
# see the data structure and summary
summary(Journals)
```

The goal is to estimate the effect of the price per citation on the number of library subscription. Therefore, we fit a linear regression model

log(subs)[i]=
