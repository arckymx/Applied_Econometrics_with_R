### 4. Factors, Interactions and Weights

Formula       | Description
------------  |------------
y ~ a + x     | Model without interaction: indentical slopes with respect to x, but different intercepts with respect to a.
Y ~ a* x      | Model with interaction: the term a:x gives the difference in slopes compared with the reference category.
y ~ a/x       | Model with interaction: produces the same fitten values as the mdoel above but using a nested coefficient coding. An explicit slope estimate is computed for each category in a.
y ~ (a+b+c)^2 | Model with all two-way interactions(excluding three way interaction).

#### Interactions

```{r}
# Let's consider an interaction between `ethnicity` and `education`
cps_int <- lm(log(wage) ~ experience + I(experience^2) + education * ethnicity, data = CPS1988)
coeftest(cps_int)
```

Resuts indicated that the interaction term is significant at the 5% level
